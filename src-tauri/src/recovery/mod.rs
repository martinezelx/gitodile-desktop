//! Persistent recovery workflows.

//! Three owners live here, and they are deliberately separate files rather
//! than one flat module. [`discard`] snapshots working-tree changes into the
//! worktree's `.git` directory (ADR 0007); [`history`] preserves a pre-rewrite
//! branch tip as a hidden ref (ADR 0008); [`conflict`] preserves a paused
//! operation's unmerged stages and working content before its first change
//! (ADR 0041). They share nothing but the clock and the worktree owner ID
//! below — before the split the first two shared a namespace, which is why
//! the history half had to prefix every helper with `history_` to avoid
//! colliding with its neighbour.
