// "Branch" is simple-mode wording for a local Git branch. This section
// owns discovery (read-only) and the create/switch/delete plan-then-execute
// contracts. Every mutation here requires `git switch` support (Git >= 2.23,
// see `require_git_switch_support`) — this is the first Git-version floor
// enforced anywhere in the app; task 002 deliberately left minimum-version
// enforcement out of scope, so the check stays local to these commands
// instead of a global gate.

/// Safety cap on how many local branches a single discovery call reports in
/// full. Chosen to comfortably cover ordinary projects while keeping the
/// per-branch reachability/uniqueness queries below bounded; counts stay
/// exact even when the list itself is truncated.
