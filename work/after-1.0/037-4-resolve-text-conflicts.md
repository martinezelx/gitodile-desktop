# Moved after 1.0.0 (2026-10-27)

`1.0.0` resolves conflicts at GitHub Desktop level (epic
[037](../0.5.0/037-guided-conflict-resolution.md)). This task now belongs to
epic [206](206-three-way-conflict-editor.md), the three-way editor after
`1.0.0`. It keeps its permanent ID. It consumes epic 037's session, snapshot
and stale-state contracts instead of defining them; re-read it against what
037 delivered before scheduling it.

# Goal

Add editable text results, per-region choices, explicit save/mark-resolved, and
per-file reset backed by the conflict snapshot.

# User outcome

For ordinary text overlaps, the user can combine both sides, edit the result,
mark a file resolved, and safely reconsider that resolution.

# Context

This is the first mutating conflict slice. Every write must consume task 037-1's
snapshot and stale-state contract.

# Scope

- Implement aligned regions, current/incoming/both choices, manual result
  editing, search, conflict navigation, undo/redo, and linear accessible mode.
- Keep edit-buffer, save-to-working-file, and mark-resolved/stage as distinct
  explicit states and mutations.
- Revalidate object IDs, file state, mode, worktree hash, session epoch, and
  snapshot before atomic/bounded writes or index changes.
- Implement per-file reset to the original conflicted stages/content using the
  verified snapshot; confirm bulk side/reset actions.
- Reconcile external edits explicitly and preserve newer content on ambiguity.

# Out of scope

- Merge completion/abort and non-text/structural conflict resolution.

# Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Region choices and manual edits produce exact expected bytes across line
      endings, long lines, missing base, Unicode, IME, and marker-like content.
- [ ] Save and mark-resolved are separate, stale-safe, verified local mutations.
- [ ] Per-file reset restores exact original stages/content/mode and refuses if
      newer work cannot be preserved.
- [ ] Restart, external edit, watcher burst, project switch, linked worktree,
      lock, permission, interruption, and uncertain outcomes retain evidence.
- [ ] Keyboard, focus, screen reader, zoom, both themes/locales, responsiveness,
      and reduced motion meet the parent acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Rust/frontend integration tests and focused checks pass.

# Dependencies

Tasks 037-1, 037-2, and 037-3.

# Decisions

No implicit staging or completion follows saving a result.

# Implementation notes

Record alignment/result model, atomic-write path, index operations, external
edit reconciliation, and reset verification.

# Validation

Record content corpus, failure injection, interaction measurements, desktop
accessibility checks, and focused command output.
