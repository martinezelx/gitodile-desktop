# Goal

Implement a project-scoped collaboration screen in
[epic 148](148-connect-github-account.md) for GitHub/Bitbucket pull requests and
GitLab merge requests, with shared UI and provider-specific API adapters.

# User outcome

See proposed changes and their checks, inspect source/target branches, create
a reviewed proposal, and safely open its branch in the local project.

# Scope

- Resolve the supported project remote and selected provider account explicitly;
  ambiguous remotes require a choice rather than guessing from the active CLI.
- Bounded paginated list/details, state/author/branch metadata, provider links
  and checks/status summaries. Unsupported provider fields are shown honestly.
- Create a proposal from a published branch after a provider-specific preview
  identifying project, account, source/target, title/body and visibility.
- Open a proposed branch using existing fetch/safe-switch planning, preserving
  dirty files and avoiding automatic stash, reset or untrusted hook bypass.
- Register the feature-owned screen in screens.tsx, with cache/invalidation,
  session epochs and hidden-effect suspension following the screen contract.
- Keep mutations narrow, permission-checked and revalidated; report uncertain
  creation outcomes and check for duplicates before suggesting a retry.

# Out of scope

- Full diff review/comment/approval suite, merges, closing proposals and branch deletion.
- Implicit publishing or history rewriting to create/open a proposal.
- CI logs/rerun/cancel/dispatch (148-7 owns the Actions screen).

# Acceptance criteria

- [ ] GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket projects use the same selected account for
  discovery/details/creation, independently of another project's account.
- [ ] Lists/details and checks represent the provider's actual states and pagination.
- [ ] Creation requires an explicit reviewed plan with permissions, branch and
  remote revalidation; unknown remote outcomes cannot encourage duplicate writes.
- [ ] Opening a branch preserves unsaved files and uses existing safety owners;
  stale project/session/remote state blocks the operation.
- [ ] Cached arrival triggers no remote request; account changes and explicit
  refresh/invalidation supersede stale responses; hidden work/announcements stop.
- [ ] Unsupported hosts, permissions, no proposals, offline/rate limits and
  loading/error states are accessible and translated; growing lists virtualize.
- [ ] Native parser/planner fixtures, session/account races, mutation failures,
  screen lifecycle and keyboard tests pass; running app is exercised.
- [ ] Document provider/platform qualification and `pnpm run check` results.

# Dependencies

Complete [148-4](148-4-gitlab-and-bitbucket-accounts.md) and
[148-5](148-5-provider-repository-browser.md) first, reusing their provider API
access and remote identity contracts instead of adding another auth path.

# Execution handoff

Implement this screen separately from CI. Read AGENTS.md, inspect existing safe
fetch/switch planners and primary provider docs, and keep the listed mutation
scope. Expand scope only with the user's explicit approval.

# Implementation notes

Pending implementation.

# Validation

Pending implementation.
