# Goal

Freeze features, validate the full product on representative systems, and ship
Tauri-signed, updateable, supportable `1.0.0` artifacts for Windows and Linux.

# User outcome

Users can install GitOdile from a verified updater package, complete every advertised
workflow on their platform, update safely, and understand compatibility and
support boundaries, including the lack of Windows publisher trust.

# Context

Compilation and unit/integration CI are not runtime, packaging, signing,
credential, accessibility, or update evidence. ADR 0006 explicitly defers
macOS/Linux runtime validation to release hardening. ADR 0011 supersedes the
macOS portion for `1.0.0`: real macOS delivery is now post-1.0.

# Scope

- Freeze the `1.0.0` capability matrix and triage every open defect by data-loss,
  remote-integrity, correctness, accessibility, security, and usability risk.
- Run the full Gate-0 workflow plus clone/create/history/integration/conflict/
  recovery/stash journeys from actual packaged artifacts on representative
  Windows and supported Linux environments.
- Execute large-repository, long-running process, watcher, memory, startup,
  screen-switch, keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, forced-colors, reduced-motion,
  locale, path, line-ending, symlink, casing, lock, and credential matrices.
- Produce Tauri-signed Windows installers and Linux packages/distributions with
  reproducible CI provenance and artifact hashes. Record Windows Authenticode
  as deferred and keep macOS absent from the supported matrix.
- Qualify the updater and publication pipeline delivered by
  [epic 065-9](065-9-signed-application-updates.md) against the final signed
  artifacts: signature verification, failure behavior, reinstall instructions,
  and no repository mutation during update. The accepted strategy is in
  [ADR 0010](../../../docs/adr/0010-distribute-signed-app-updates-through-public-github-releases.md).
- Complete versioning, release notes, privacy/security/support docs, install and
  uninstall behavior, crash/log locations, known limitations, and upgrade tests.
- Run an independent final safety audit and the aggregate repository gate.

# Out of scope

- Adding features after freeze to improve competitive parity.
- Claiming support for an untested OS/distribution/architecture.
- Telemetry, accounts, or a mandatory update service.

# Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every roadmap Gate 0–3 task is done and the frozen matrix maps advertised
      behavior to automated plus actual-artifact evidence.
- [ ] No open blocker/critical issue can lose work, corrupt state, expose a
      credential, misreport a remote result, or prevent a primary workflow.
- [ ] Representative Windows and documented Linux artifacts pass the
      complete smoke/workflow/platform/accessibility matrix from clean installs.
- [ ] Updater signatures, package provenance and hashes verify through the
      normal installation path; uninstall preserves user repositories and the
      Windows documentation discloses its unknown publisher.
- [ ] Update success, unavailable update, interrupted download/install, invalid
      signature, rollback/reinstall, and older-settings migration are tested.
- [ ] Startup, memory, interaction, large-repository, watcher, and process
      results are recorded against retained budgets with no unexplained regressions.
- [ ] README, changelog/release notes, privacy, security, install, update,
      troubleshooting, support, and known-limitations docs match shipped behavior.
- [ ] Version metadata is `1.0.0`, `pnpm run check` passes on the release commit,
      CI is green, and artifact/version provenance is recorded.

# Dependencies

- Tasks 015, 037, 064, and 065-1 through 065-7 complete.
- Epic 065-9 and all seven children complete; its signed updater and publication pipeline complete before freeze.
- Access to representative Windows and Linux QA environments.

# Decisions

- Feature freeze begins when this task starts.
- Support claims follow actual packaged-artifact evidence.
- Tauri updater signing, update safety, and recovery are correctness requirements.
- ADR 0011 defers Authenticode and macOS delivery until after `1.0.0`.

# Implementation notes

Record supported OS/distribution/architecture matrix, signing identities and CI
design without secrets, artifact formats, updater decision/ADR, defects fixed,
and residual known limitations.

# Validation

Record release commit/tag, CI URLs, artifact hashes, signing/notarization
verification, platform hardware/software matrix, full QA results, independent
audit, and final aggregate check.
