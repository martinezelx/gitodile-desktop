# Goal

Everything that was still open across the updater epic when it was closed on
2026-09-16, in one place: the real installed A-to-B evidence for Windows and
Linux, the publisher evidence a production approval needs, the qualification
registry and working-name clearance that turn `stable-testing` /
`preview-testing` into `production` / `preview-qualified`, and OS-level
signing (SignPath Foundation) for both channels. The code, pipeline and
contracts are delivered; what remains is evidence, operations and one signing
integration.

# User outcome

- Windows and Linux users can trust that an in-app update was proven on real
  installations, not only in tests, and Windows users stop seeing
  unknown-publisher/SmartScreen warnings once OS signing lands.
- Stable and preview releases stop carrying the "Testing release/preview"
  notice once the registry proves both targets.

# Context

On 2026-09-16 the maintainer closed epic 065-9 and its children 065-9-5 through
065-9-11 as done: the signed-build pipeline, merge-driven coordinator, public
publisher, native updater, channel choice, tag-dated What's new and
notes-from-highlights automation are all on `main`, and `0.2.0-preview.10`,
`.11` and `.12` were built, published and installed through the public
`preview.json`. Their unchecked acceptance criteria were evidence and
operations items, not code, and are consolidated here so the epic's history
stays honest. Task 065-9-12 (2026-09-15) put stable releases under the
`stable-testing` publication policy — Tauri updater signature only — so both
channels can be exercised end to end before this task completes.

The plan for OS signing changed with that decision: instead of Authenticode
only after `1.0.0` (task 065-9-9, ADR 0011), the maintainer intends to apply
for SignPath Foundation and sign **both** stable and preview releases once
the application is accepted. ADR 0011 must be amended when that happens.

Evidence rules do not change: a compile-only artifact, a mocked replacement
or a test fixture never closes a platform criterion; only real installed
transitions between two public releases do, recorded against the schema-4
registry described in `docs/release/updater-qualification.md`.

# Scope

## A. Installed A-to-B evidence (from 065-9-7 / 065-9-8)

- For each enabled target (Windows x86-64 per-user NSIS, Linux x86-64
  AppImage), record one real A-to-B transition between two consecutive public
  previews served through `preview.json`: OS version, architecture, install
  path class (including one path with spaces/non-ASCII), settings, sessions,
  volatile drafts, dirty tracked and untracked files, another open project, an
  active operation and a helper all preserved; Git history unchanged.
- Record the required failure matrix per target with real artifacts: offline,
  feed unavailable, target unavailable, corrupt/truncated download, invalid
  signature, cancellation, insufficient space, locked installation, read-only
  installation, interrupted handoff, reinstall, managed-package fallback — no
  false success and no forced downgrade in any case.
- Exercise the channel choice for real: a stable build opting into previews
  and a preview build restricted to stable, both through the public feeds.
- Write the schema-4 evidence into `docs/release/update-target-qualifications.json`
  (`status: qualified`, one evidence record per target) and land it through a
  release pull request, the only diff the coordinator accepts for that file.

## B. Publisher evidence and production approval (from 065-9-6 / 065-9-10)

- Record, from real public publications: a completed publication, an
  interrupted retry that reconciled without change, immutable assets,
  anonymous downloads with hashes, and the advanced feed — the five
  `REQUIRED_PUBLISHER_CHECKS`.
- Run the first `stable-testing` release end to end (reviewer approval on
  `public-release-stable`, `stable.json` created, `preview.json` advanced) and
  record it as pipeline evidence.
- Obtain and record written working-name clearance.
- Enable `productionPromotion` in the registry with the updater key identity
  it covers; from then on stable publishes as `production` and previews as
  `preview-qualified`, without the testing notice. Only then set the
  repository variable `GITODILE_QUALIFIED_UPDATE_TARGETS=windows-x86_64,linux-x86_64`
  and decide whether `GITODILE_TEST_UPDATE_TARGETS` narrows back to preview.

## C. Public-repository controls (from 065-9-8)

- Confirm and record that Secret Scanning / Push Protection and the
  applicable dependency and code scanning are enabled and clean on
  `martinezelx/gitodile-desktop` and `martinezelx/gitodile`, or record the
  explicit mitigation for any unavailable control.
- Re-run the public-readiness audit checklist against the current tree and
  record the result beside `docs/release/public-readiness-audit-2026-09-12.md`.

## D. OS signing for both channels (replaces 065-9-9)

- Apply for SignPath Foundation (or record why another provider was chosen);
  document the provider and certificate identity without secrets in
  `docs/CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md`.
- Integrate the reviewed remote-signing step into `release-pipeline.yml`
  between the unsigned build and updater signing, for stable **and** preview,
  keeping Actions commit-pinned, least-privileged and secretless outside the
  signing environment; the updater signature must still cover the final
  OS-signed bytes.
- Record Authenticode chain, timestamp and revocation verification in the
  evidence, retire `authenticode_deferred` for signed releases, and update
  `make-os-trust.mjs`, the qualification validator, the download guidance and
  the README notice.
- Amend ADR 0011 (Authenticode no longer deferred past `1.0.0`; both channels
  signed) and ADR 0010's signing section.

## E. Pending evidence from 065-9-11

- Record that a preview built from 065-9-11 (`0.2.0-preview.12`) updated an
  installed `0.2.0-preview.11` through the public feed, if it did; otherwise
  record the first transition that proves the check-time gate reporting and
  forward-compatible manifest on a real installation.

# Out of scope

- macOS delivery and qualification (task 065-10).
- Any change to the two-channel model, the feeds or the renderer boundary.
- Describing pre-signing packages as Authenticode-signed or OS-trusted.

# Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Both enabled targets carry a valid schema-4 `qualified` record from
      real public previews, with the preservation and failure matrices
      complete; `pnpm run check` accepts the registry.
- [ ] `productionPromotion.enabled` is true with evidenced working-name
      clearance and the five publisher checks; `derivePublicationMode`
      answers `production` / `preview-qualified` and the testing notice is
      gone from new releases.
- [ ] One stable release was published through `stable-testing` before that
      switch and one through `production` after it, both recorded.
- [ ] The channel choice was exercised on real installations in both
      directions and recorded.
- [ ] Windows packages on both channels are OS-signed through the chosen
      provider, verified (chain, timestamp, revocation) in evidence, and the
      unknown-publisher notice is removed from public guidance only after that
      evidence exists.
- [ ] ADR 0011, `docs/CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md`, the runbooks and README
      describe the delivered state; `pnpm run check` and
      `pnpm run check:publication` pass on the enabling commits.

# Dependencies

- Real Windows and Linux hosts (hardware or VMs) for part A.
- SignPath Foundation acceptance (or the alternative provider) for part D.
- Parts A–C can proceed independently of D; the testing notice is removed by
  B, not by D.

# Decisions

- 2026-09-16: the epic and its remaining children were closed as delivered
  code; evidence and operations work is tracked here as one task so the
  updater's history is not spread across seven half-open files.
- 2026-09-16: OS signing will target both channels through SignPath
  Foundation, superseding 065-9-9's post-1.0 Authenticode-only plan; ADR 0011
  is amended when the signing lands, not before.
