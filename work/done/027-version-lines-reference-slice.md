# Goal

Prove the architecture from Tauri adapter through Rust service and frontend
controller by migrating Version lines without changing discovery, create,
switch or delete behavior.

# User outcome

Version lines behave exactly as before while providing a complete example for
new read and mutation features.

# Scope

- Create a Version-lines frontend feature with UI, controller/store, domain
  types, typed port and Tauri adapter.
- Register its `ScreenModule` through task 026's single path.
- Implement the standard bounded project-snapshot lifecycle: session epoch,
  one in-flight request per query, dedupe, monotonic generation/cancellation,
  stale rejection, cache/no-loading-flash, stable equality, last-snapshot error,
  explicit invalidation and bounded eviction.
- Keep feature-specific equality, tokens and invalidation decisions in the
  feature rather than a catch-all cache.
- Migrate the Rust Version-lines DTOs, parser, planner, service, domain errors
  and tests behind task 024's runner/access boundaries.
- Preserve command names/payloads through task 025's compatibility contracts.
- Keep create/switch/delete previews, common-Git-dir exclusion, dirty-tree
  checks, state tokens and unique-work safety intact.
- Preserve the closed Version-lines interaction contract: search, filters,
  `Local-only first` semantics, viewport-bounded filter content, shared popup
  focus/dismissal behavior, Arrow/Home/End/Escape/typeahead keyboard support,
  and English/Spanish copy.
- Document the reference slice and which parts are mandatory versus
  feature-specific.

# Out of scope

- Renaming Version lines or changing UI/copy.
- History or a general branch graph.
- Generalizing the cache beyond behavior proven here.

# Acceptance criteria

- [x] Version lines no longer places UI, lifecycle or IPC orchestration in
      `main.tsx`.
- [x] Its Rust parser/planners/workflows no longer live in `lib.rs`.
- [x] Concurrent dedupe, mutation supersession, cached unchanged/changed/error,
      project switch and close/reopen epoch tests pass.
- [x] Watcher worktree/shared-ref invalidation follows task 025's taxonomy.
- [x] Navigation never invokes a Version-lines command by itself.
- [x] Create/switch/delete safety and temporary-repository tests remain
      behaviorally equivalent.
- [x] Related worktrees cannot execute conflicting mutations through direct
      IPC calls.
- [x] Hidden screen behavior, memory, chunks, switch timings and Git process
      counts satisfy task 023's budgets.
- [x] Popup, filtering, sorting, keyboard and focus tests remain behaviorally
      equivalent after UI/controller ownership moves.
- [x] A short implementation guide explains how History should use the proven
      contracts without copying feature-specific policy.

# Dependencies

Tasks 024, 025 and 026.

# Decisions

- Version lines is the full read+mutation pilot because it exercises every
  important boundary.
- Only proven lifecycle mechanics become reusable policy.

# Implementation notes

- The frontend slice now lives under `src/features/version-lines/`: `domain.ts`
  owns feature types, `port.ts` is the seven-operation typed boundary,
  `tauriAdapter.ts` is the sole renderer owner of Version-lines command names,
  and `controller.ts`/`store.ts`/`hooks.ts` own the snapshot lifecycle. The
  screen and dialogs remain lazy through the feature `ScreenModule`; `main.tsx`
  only composes the controller, screen and cross-feature callbacks.
- Controller queries are keyed by canonical project id plus Rust-issued
  session epoch. They deduplicate one in-flight read, reject superseded
  generations, retain equal snapshots and the last good snapshot on errors,
  freeze hidden-screen subscriptions, evict on close/reopen and cap inactive
  cache entries at eight. A mutation result commits its fresh snapshot before
  shared repository facts refresh.
- Worktree-only invalidations do not reread Version lines. Head/ref and shared
  repository invalidations schedule an idle refresh for the matching epoch;
  shared events continue to fan out through task 025's session registry.
- Rust DTOs, parser, plans, workflows, error classification and their 31 tests
  moved intact to `src-tauri/src/version_lines.rs`. Tauri command adapters stay
  in `ipc.rs`; task 024's application authorization and common-Git-dir
  coordinator remain the authoritative serialization boundary. A syntax-based
  architecture test prevents Version-lines code from returning to `lib.rs` or
  depending on IPC, watcher, session or Tauri modules.
- The task-025 contract retains all command names and exact payload casing,
  including `switch` and `sessionEpoch`. The compatibility inventory now has
  no legacy Version-lines renderer consumer.
- [The reference-slice guide](../../docs/architecture/version-lines-reference-slice.md)
  separates mandatory runtime/port/adapter/Rust-boundary mechanics from
  Version-lines-specific equality, invalidation, tokens and mutation policy,
  and gives History a short adoption path without adding work to a composition
  root.
- The keep-alive slot key now uses the session epoch rather than the active
  path, so close/reopen cannot retain an old screen incarnation. This is part
  of the required epoch lifecycle, not a user-visible behavior change.

## Measurements

- Production build: entry JavaScript 368.62 kB raw / 107.46 kB gzip, below
  the 378/110 kB warning budget; Changes stayed 59.38 kB and `fileIcons`
  stayed deferred at 255.22 kB. Version-lines screen plus dialog chunks total
  31.23 kB raw, below the 36 kB warning budget.
- Windows 11/WebView2 development profile, standard five-line fixture, one
  warm-up then 20 cycles each way: Overview to Version lines p50 31.6 ms,
  p95 32.4 ms, max 33.2 ms; Version lines to Overview p50 31.0 ms, p95
  32.6 ms, max 32.7 ms. Both directions are below the 40 ms warning and
  50 ms failure budgets. Visible descendant counts were 158/220, below 1,200.
- A task-scoped `GIT_TRACE2_EVENT` capture around a separate 20-cycle warm
  navigation sample recorded zero Git process starts. The raw trace was
  deleted after aggregating the count.
- Task 023 permits tasks 024-030 to report memory as informational when screen
  retention does not change. This migration preserves the one-slot-per-visited
  screen keep-alive model, suspends the hidden subscription and bounds its new
  snapshot cache to eight inactive entries; release memory remains for task
  031's required cross-platform final measurement.

# Validation

- `pnpm run check:frontend` passed: dependency architecture guard, strict
  typecheck, 22 test files / 219 tests and production build.
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check` passed.
- `cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
  passed.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features`
  passed: 195 library tests and 0 binary tests. The focused Version-lines set
  contains 31 passing temporary-repository/parser/planner/workflow tests; the
  repository-access suite also passes its related-worktree serialization test.
- Automated UI coverage passes for no-read-on-arrival, hidden freeze and
  reactivation, popup dismissal/focus, keyboard navigation/typeahead,
  viewport-bounded filters, sorting and English/Spanish behavior.
- Native smoke testing at 1280x720 showed one visible screen slot, no
  horizontal overflow and no console warnings/errors.
