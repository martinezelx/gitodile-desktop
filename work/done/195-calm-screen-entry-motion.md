# Goal

Show available content immediately when navigating, retain useful motion and
preserve the user's place in Work, defaulting to the first item when no valid
selection exists.

# Approved scope

Requested directly after the animation audit, ahead of the existing queue,
on the existing `release/0.4.1` branch. The user requested one combined task,
a code review with justified fixes, the complete check gate and a commit.
The temporary task 196 was folded here before committing; its ID stays reserved.

- Remove the rail icon's entry scale, Home recent-project and Overview version
  row cascades, and Branches' first-result drawing sequence.
- Preserve Branches' 200ms branch-to-branch cross-fade and loading placeholder.
- Shorten Overview's compact restoration card fade to the normal 180ms token.
- Show Console's initial welcome drawing immediately; retain the reveal when
  a command moves it to the watermark or clearing a nonempty transcript
  restores the welcome. Revisits and empty clears do not replay the entrance.
- Preserve Home's animated prompt and once-per-session mascot greeting as the
  user requested, including the existing typing speed. Retain new-row feedback
  in Changes/History and motion for progress, menus and panels.
- Default Changes and History file lists to folders, respecting explicit saved
  flat-list choices and the existing shared preference and toggle.
- Resolve initial/missing file selections in the selected layout's order,
  rather than Git's payload order, including cached History detail.
- Updated user clarification: palette, rail and tab entry preserve an existing
  valid branch/version/file selection and the user's scroll/folds. The first
  file/version is the fallback only when no valid selection exists. Particular
  file/version links keep their target. Refresh, Back/Forward and project
  restoration retain their existing selection semantics.
- Review the final implementation for bugs, regressions and justified improvements.

# Acceptance criteria

- [x] Available screen content has no decorative entry delay; useful motion
      and the Home exceptions above remain, including reduced motion.
- [x] Console only reveals the drawing when commands/clearing relocate it.
- [x] Both file lists default to trees and preserve a stored flat-list choice.
- [x] Initial file selection follows the layout before reading its diff.
- [x] Generic navigation preserves the user's selection, scroll and folds;
      initial/missing selections fall back to the first item in display order.
- [x] Final code review and regression checks are recorded below.
- [x] The aggregate `pnpm run check` passes; platform validation is reported honestly.

# Platform implications

CSS motion, file-layout storage and lifecycle contracts remain shared across
Windows, macOS and Linux. No Git operations, native APIs, dependencies or
storage migrations are introduced. App/OS reduced-motion preferences still apply.

# Implementation and review

Removed unconditional entrance classes, index variables and obsolete Branches
reveal state/keyframes. ConsoleMascot accepts an entrance choice at mount;
ConsoleScreen enables it only after clearing a nonempty transcript. Its
existing lifecycle finishes interrupted reveals while hidden or under reduced
motion. Home's prompt implementation/timing is unchanged.

The shared file-layout reader accepts an explicit `list` and otherwise returns
`tree`, including unavailable storage. A shared selection policy preserves a
valid explicit path or chooses the first path in the layout. History applies
it to fresh/cached detail before a diff read. Navigation preserves existing
state without restarting the History page. Explicit version/file links set the
requested selection before opening the destination. Branch scope changes keep
a valid choice and validate unreachable selections through the existing detail
read; opening the same scope does not reset it.

Page arrivals honour the current selection instead of a choice captured before
the read started. The initial implementation reset generic navigation, based on
the earlier first-item request; the user then clarified that an existing choice
must survive navigation. Removed the root's selection resets and the associated
first-version/revision machinery. A retained timeline holds its live DOM scroll,
including before the debounced value is saved, and keeps folded version blocks.
A superseded branch/version intent cannot reapply its target after a newer
scope. Selected file
changes reveal their containing folders; Changes' initial/fallback selection
uses matching files while preserving a valid explicit selection across filters.

# Validation before the selection-preservation clarification

- Regression coverage includes Console command/clear/revisit/reduced-motion
  behavior, tree defaults and persisted flat-list choices, folder inclusion and
  folding, fresh/cached file selection with a single initial diff read,
  palette/rail/tab entry, explicit older-version links and retained scrolling.
- Windows Tauri validation using the Computer Use skill covered Overview's
  immediate 30-version list, Console's immediate welcome and command/Ctrl+L
  reveals, revisits, Branches' first route and another branch's details, and
  Home's immediate recent rows alongside its retained greeting/typing. No
  visual/layout problems were found in those exercised flows. No Git branch
  switch was executed.
- A duplicate Vite startup found port 1420 occupied; verified the existing
  server belonged to this checkout and reused it. Closed only the temporary
  native process after validation, retaining the user's app/server.
- Later interactive validation was stopped by the user with physical Escape.
  Folder defaults and navigation selection were validated through automated
  tests; no further Computer Use was performed. macOS/Linux were not run
  interactively.
- The aggregate gate before the final review passed: all 148 frontend files /
  1,597 tests, build, docs/release/icon/architecture checks, TypeScript, Rust
  formatting, Clippy and 623 Rust library + 1 integration tests; 1 existing Rust
  test ignored. The build retains its existing 500kB chunk warning.
- Windows' running app locks the normal debug executable. Checks use the ignored
  `src-tauri/target/check-195` directory via `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` so validation
  does not close the user's app.
- Final focused review regressions: 5 files / 150 tests passed. They cover late
  refresh completion, superseded scoped version links, an unsaved scroll offset
  on a filtered timeline, revealing a selected file's folded folder, and
  missing/invalid/unavailable storage alongside explicit tree/list preferences.
- Final aggregate `pnpm run check` with
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=src-tauri/target/check-195`: passed (exit 0) after all review
  fixes. Docs/release/icon contracts, architecture, TypeScript, all 148 frontend
  files / 1,605 tests, production build, Rust formatting, Clippy and all-target /
  all-feature Rust tests passed: 623 library tests plus 1 credential-helper
  integration test, with 1 existing library test ignored. The build retains its
  existing chunk-size warning. No further actionable issues were found in the
  reviewed diff and exercised flows; this is not a claim of exhaustive UI or
  cross-platform validation.
- After recording the final result, documentation and diff whitespace were
  checked again before committing.

# Selection-preservation follow-up validation

- The full-app regression now checks the clarified policy: first file/version
  on initial entry, then retained selected version/file, timeline DOM and scroll,
  Changes folder folds, palette/rail/tab navigation and a selected non-active
  branch after leaving and returning. Explicit version links still override
  the retained choice. History-page and branch-inventory reads remain at one.
- Targeted navigation regression: passed. Related History/Changes/Overview
  regressions: 6 files / 209 tests passed. The additional Changes regression
  passed: a new snapshot preserves the chosen file while it exists, then falls
  back to the first tree file when that file disappears.
- TypeScript, documentation metadata/links and diff whitespace passed during
  iteration. No further native Computer Use was performed after the user's
  earlier Escape stop; these follow-up flows were exercised by automated tests.
- Final aggregate `pnpm run check` after this correction: passed (exit 0),
  using `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=src-tauri/target/check-195`. All 148 frontend files /
  1,606 tests, build, docs/release/icon/architecture checks, TypeScript, Rust
  formatting, Clippy, 623 Rust library tests and 1 integration test passed;
  1 existing Rust library test was ignored. The existing chunk-size warning
  remains. Documentation and whitespace were checked again after this record.
