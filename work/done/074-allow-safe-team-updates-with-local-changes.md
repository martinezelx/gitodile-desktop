# Goal

Let **Review and get** advance a strictly behind version line when prepared or
unsaved tracked changes are demonstrably separate from every incoming path,
without stashing, discarding, or silently altering local work.

# User outcome

People can receive unrelated team documentation or code while continuing
local work. A real path overlap still stops safely and explains the relevant
team-update problem instead of incorrectly referring to switching version
lines.

# Context

The original fast-forward implementation rejected every dirty tracked working
tree before inspecting incoming paths. That conservative first version kept
work safe, but blocked updates Git's two-tree `read-tree` operation can carry
without loss. It also reused the global `dirty_working_tree` translation, whose
remediation was written specifically for version-line switching.

# Scope

- Parse ordinary, renamed, staged, and unstaged tracked paths from porcelain-v2
  status while retaining both sides of a rename.
- Compare tracked paths with the complete bounded incoming-path evidence.
- Run `git read-tree --dry-run -u -m <old> <target>` before offering a plan when
  tracked local work exists.
- Bind the exact tracked status and worktree-content fingerprint into the plan
  token, including regular-file bytes and symbolic-link targets.
- Verify after the update that the reviewed staged and unstaged state is still
  exact while incoming files and `HEAD` reached the reviewed commit.
- Keep conservative blocking when incoming evidence is truncated or a local
  path cannot be inspected safely.
- Add a dedicated incoming tracked-change collision error and truthful English
  and Spanish team-update copy.
- Update the IPC contract and durable architecture description.

# Safety contract

- The operation remains strict fast-forward only.
- GitOdrile never stashes, discards, merges, rebases, resets, or force-updates
  local work.
- Planning is non-mutating apart from the existing explicit fetch; the
  `read-tree` preflight uses `--dry-run`.
- A local edit made after preview invalidates the token before recovery or
  history mutation.
- Incoming/local collisions, unresolved states, unsupported paths, and
  incomplete evidence block instead of guessing.
- Execution retains the existing durable recovery reference and uncertain
  outcome handling.

# Acceptance criteria

- [x] Separate unstaged tracked changes allow Review and get.
- [x] Separate staged additions allow Review and get without changing the
      index during planning.
- [x] Staged, unstaged, and untracked work remains present after a successful
      fast-forward.
- [x] A local rename overlapping an incoming source or destination blocks with
      `incoming_tracked_change_collision`.
- [x] More than the bounded incoming-file evidence blocks when tracked local
      work prevents a complete non-overlap proof.
- [x] Editing an already-dirty file after preview makes the plan stale before
      recovery is created.
- [x] The dialog no longer describes a team-update collision as a version-line
      switch failure.

# Validation

- `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/detect.mjs --json` returned no
  findings.
- `pnpm run check` passed: documentation and architecture checks, TypeScript,
  420 frontend tests, production build, Rust formatting, Clippy, and 297 Rust
  tests.
