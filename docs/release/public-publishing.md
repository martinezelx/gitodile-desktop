# Public release publishing

This runbook implements the public promotion half of
[ADR 0010](../adr/0010-distribute-signed-app-updates-through-public-github-releases.md),
with the single channel of
[ADR 0019](../adr/0019-publish-updates-through-one-channel.md). It consumes the package-only output of the
[protected signed-build pipeline](signed-builds.md); it never compiles or signs an
application and never accepts a local installer path supplied to the privileged
job.

No qualified production publication is currently authorized. The narrow
`testing` policy automatically publishes a Tauri-signed `X.Y.Z` release
without platform qualification, as a non-prerelease GitHub release that
advances `updates/latest.json`.
It changes no qualification state and claims no installation succeeded.
The qualification registry
[`update-target-qualifications.json`](update-target-qualifications.json) is
deny-by-default: Windows x86-64 and Linux x86-64 remain
`qualification_required`, both macOS targets are `planned_disabled`,
working-name clearance is not evidenced, and `productionPromotion.enabled` is
false. Tasks 065-9-7 and 065-9-8 may replace the enabled-target states only
after recording the real
signed A-to-B evidence described by the
[updater qualification runbook](updater-qualification.md). Schema version 4
binds each record to its target, two real consecutive public releases,
the public feed that served the update, preservation/failure results and
platform trust; the retired schema-3 records and older shallow forms are
rejected.

## Promotion model

Publication is the last two jobs, `stage` and `publish`, of
`.github/workflows/release-pipeline.yml`; there is no separate publication
trigger. They run only after `updater-sign` succeeded in the same run and
consume only that run's `private-signed-<tag>` artifact. The publication mode
is derived from the signed matrix and the reviewed qualification registry
(`derivePublicationMode` in `scripts/release/public-release.mjs`), never
chosen: a release is `production` when the registry already proves both
enabled targets and production approval, and `testing` otherwise.
Ordinary pushes, pull requests, merges and tags cannot publish directly, and
there is no draft-only mode or dispatch input that selects a mode.

- automatic `testing` accepts only a Tauri-signed `X.Y.Z` release, requires
  the complete Windows NSIS/Linux AppImage matrix, preserves
  `authenticode_deferred`, rejects every macOS target and finalizes a
  non-prerelease GitHub release. It deliberately accepts
  `qualification_required` targets and returns an empty `qualifiedTargets`
  list; it is publication-pipeline testing, not target qualification. The
  publisher prepends a fixed bilingual "Testing release" notice saying
  exactly that to the public release body and updater notes, independent of
  the curated change summary.
- automatic `production` accepts only a production-signing profile and
  requires a registry that approves production plus every exact enabled
  target in the signed matrix. A missing or malformed A/B proof blocks the
  entire release; the publisher never drops the failed row to make a partial
  manifest.

The unprivileged `stage` job records the identity of its own pipeline run
(release pipeline, `workflow_dispatch`, protected `main`, healthy), checks the
live feedback contract, rehashes the
complete enabled signed matrix, checks updater and OS-trust evidence independently,
validates the release version, and creates a
public-only bundle. That bundle contains packages, updater signatures,
`LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`, curated notes, the manifest template
and the reviewed publisher runtime. It does not expose the source SHA as an asset,
as a public asset, evidence files, candidate archives, signing material or a
credential. `latest.json` and `SHA256SUMS` are not staged: their bytes depend
on the release's publication time, so the `publish` job renders them.

Manifest notes are the curated Markdown reduced to plain text with its block
structure kept (`normalizeNotes`): hard-wrapped lines of one paragraph or
list item are joined, list items keep a `- ` marker and one newline between
them, paragraphs keep a blank line, and the 16 KiB bound still applies.

The manifest also carries `highlights`: the lines of
`docs/release/highlights/v<version>.json` (`--highlights`, required), in both
languages with their glyph names, so the update dialog shows what a version
brings the way What's new does, in the reader's language. An empty list adds
no field and the app falls back to the notes. See
[app-update contracts](../architecture/app-update-contracts.md).

Only the `publish` job enters a destination environment and receives
`GITODILE_PUBLIC_RELEASE_TOKEN`. Use a short-lived GitHub App installation token
with Contents write access only to `martinezelx/gitodile`; a narrowly
scoped expiring fine-grained PAT is the temporary fallback. This job does not
check out the source repository, and it is serialized across every release
through the `gitodile-publication` concurrency group so an older run can never
race a newer one at the feeds. Source visibility is not an authorization
boundary. Every release, in either mode, publishes through the one
`public-release` environment, which holds `GITODILE_PUBLIC_RELEASE_TOKEN`
and allows protected branches only. Whether it also requires a reviewer is a
maintainer setting: a reviewer adds one approval per release; `production`
additionally needs the 065-9-7/065-9-8 evidence review and working-name
clearance in the registry. An environment without the secret fails closed
before any destination request.

## Immutable release sequence

1. Add reviewed notes at `docs/release/notes/v<version>.md`, and the
   bilingual in-app highlights at `docs/release/highlights/v<version>.json`,
   on the one `release/<version>` branch produced by
   `pnpm run release:prepare <version>` (a plain `X.Y.Z`). Run it from a
   clean, current `main` when the version starts, then develop the version on
   that branch; it may also be run from a work branch that contains
   `origin/main`, which is renamed in place. The branch must not touch
   `.github/` or `scripts/release/`. Before merging, run `pnpm run release:notes`
   so the notes' `## Highlights` block is rendered from the highlights file
   (the coordinator refuses a release whose two descriptions disagree).
   Do not generate
   them from source or feedback commits and do not include private links,
   authenticated URLs, local paths, credentials or signing details.
2. Merging the release pull request starts the coordinator, which tags and
   dispatches one `Release <tag> at <sha>` pipeline run. Its `updater-sign` job
   produces the single `private-signed-v<version>` artifact; `matrix.json`
   remains `publicPromotionAllowed: false` and the `stage` job supplies the
   separate promotion decision. All targets record the same updater public-key
   ID.
3. On the first single-channel publication, inspect the published release,
   asset names, hashes, the prerelease flag (false), public tag and curated
   notes, and confirm that `latest.json` carries the release manifest; re-run the `publish` job once to prove reconciliation without
   change. This is publisher evidence for the production approval, not target
   qualification.
4. Before target qualification is complete, a signed release automatically
   enters `testing`; record it as pipeline evidence, never as an
   installed-update pass. After 065-9-7/065-9-8 have recorded both enabled
   targets and production approval, later releases enter `production`. Do not
   edit the notes or qualification registry during a retry.
5. The `publish` job creates the public lightweight tag at a commit in the
   feedback repository and reconciles one draft release. Drafts are found by
   listing releases, because GitHub does not resolve a draft by its tag.
   Existing bytes are downloaded and hashed. While the release is still a
   draft, nobody could download it, so a missing asset is uploaded and a
   differing one is replaced: a re-dispatched pipeline rebuilds installers
   that are not byte-reproducible. A stale `latest.json` or `SHA256SUMS` on a
   draft is removed, because both are rendered after publishing. Once the
   release is published it is immutable: a conflicting byte, unexpected asset
   or missing package stops the run, and nothing is deleted, renamed or
   replaced.
6. Publishing the draft is the instant GitHub records as `published_at`.
   The `publish` job reads it back from the release and renders `latest.json`
   (with that instant as `pub_date`) and `SHA256SUMS` from the plan; both are
   functions of the fixed packages and that timestamp, so a retry renders the
   same bytes. A derived asset still missing from the published release is
   uploaded — the one addition a published release accepts, since it changes
   no byte anybody could have downloaded — and one that exists must match
   exactly. Then every asset is downloaded anonymously and its SHA-256
   rechecked, with a bounded retry (6 attempts, 10 s apart) because the
   download CDN can answer 404 briefly after the release itself is public; a
   persistent failure stops the run before any feed changes. Only then does
   the job prepare the complete feed manifest and update the public `main`
   tree with one compare-and-swap Git commit. A concurrent move of `main`
   fails rather than overwriting it.
7. To retry an uncertain publication, re-run the failed jobs of the same
   pipeline run; the `publish` job is idempotent against the destination. Do
   not dispatch a second pipeline for a tag whose run succeeded; the
   coordinator refuses to, and a manual dispatch would only reconcile the same
   immutable release.

Every manifest URL names `/releases/download/v<version>/<asset>`. A
prerelease version is refused before any feed is touched, and no release is a
GitHub prerelease. Each publication writes the manifest to `latest.json`:
equal versions must have byte-identical manifests, and an older version fails
closed. It is the only feed file.

The asset and manifest set is exactly Windows x86-64 NSIS plus Linux x86-64
AppImage. A Darwin target or macOS-looking asset is an error while task 065-10
is open. A `testing` publication confirms only the immutable signed matrix,
curated notes, release identity, destination and unknown-publisher
disclosure; it does not satisfy a registry evidence field by itself.
Production approval records name clearance and the publisher behaviour
observed on real testing publications (a completed testing publication, an
interrupted retry that reconciled without change, immutable assets, anonymous
downloads and the advanced feed), and names the updater key identity it
covers. Each enabled target's installed A-to-B proof between two public
releases is recorded separately in its own registry entry.

## Retry and recovery

Re-run with the same inputs after an interruption. The coordinator reads the
remote release before acting: a matching draft keeps matching assets and adds
only missing ones; a finalized release is read-only and must already match
completely, except that a derived `latest.json` or `SHA256SUMS` still missing
after an interrupted run is rendered from the recorded `published_at` and
uploaded. If final publication succeeded but feed promotion did not, the
retry anonymously verifies the finalized assets again and attempts only the
conflict-checked feed commit. Never delete a release/tag or upload a new byte
under the same version to repair a failed run. Fix the infrastructure or issue
a higher version.

GitHub raw-content caching makes a feed update eventually visible. Do not
rewrite the commit to force cache invalidation. Check the repository contents
API for the committed byte identity, then poll the anonymous raw endpoint with
a bounded delay before declaring operational propagation; installed clients
may see the previous complete manifest during that interval.

To withdraw a bad candidate, make a reviewed commit restoring the previous
complete feed manifest. Keep the release, tag and installers. Withdrawal stops
new offers only after caches expire; it does not recall a download, uninstall a
version or promise rollback. Publish a higher-version repair when possible.
Old signed installers remain available for manual reinstall and updater-key
rotation bridges.

The `publish` job updates the feedback README download block in the same
conflict-checked commit as the first feed change. The issue forms are never
written. The `stage` job runs `check-public-feedback.mjs --publication-plan`,
which checks their filenames, IDs, labels, private security channel,
repository settings and the planned README guidance against the live
destination before the privileged job. It does not repeat the repository gate
(`pnpm run check`): that gate already ran in CI on the exact merge SHA and the
coordinator required it, whereas the staging job checks out protected `main`'s
current tip. `pnpm run check:publication` remains the local pre-release
command that combines both.

## Current external blockers

- The protected environments and the production updater identity were
  configured on 2026-09-12; the retired validation identity and its
  environment are no longer referenced and should be deleted.
- The local encrypted updater-key recovery copy passed restore/sign/verify.
  The independent offline production backup and real Authenticode identity are
  deferred to task 065-9-9. Apple credentials are deliberately out of scope
  with macOS disabled under task 065-10.
- The destination environment and destination-scoped publisher credential must
  be independently verified before the first single-channel publication;
  their presence is not target qualification.
- Neither enabled target has the installed A-to-B evidence between two real
  public releases required by 065-9-7/065-9-8. macOS retains its separate
  replacement-safety blocker without entering this release matrix.
- Written clearance for the working name is not evidenced.

Local fixtures, mocked trust values and workflow parsing prove the contracts,
not signing, notarization, anonymous production downloads, operating-system
trust or installed update success.
