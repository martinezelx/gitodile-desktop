# ADR 0041: Read conflict sessions from Git and snapshot them before any change

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-10-28
- Extends: [ADR 0007](0007-store-discard-recovery-in-worktree-git-metadata.md)
  and [ADR 0008](0008-store-history-recovery-as-versioned-hidden-refs.md)
  with a third recovery owner; amends point 7 of
  [ADR 0030](0030-forecast-and-combine-project-changes.md) for task 065-4

## Context

Epic 037 lets a user resolve a paused merge inside GitOdile at GitHub Desktop
level: keep one whole side per file or edit it in their own editor, mark it
resolved, reset it, and finish or abort the merge. Before any of that can
write to a conflicted file or to the index, GitOdile needs one contract for
what a paused operation is, who started it, which side is which, how a stale
view is detected, and what is preserved before the first change.

Most paused merges are not started by GitOdile. A terminal, an editor or a
coding agent leaves `MERGE_HEAD` and unmerged index entries behind, possibly
over uncommitted work whose earlier state nobody recorded. Coding agents also
rebase, cherry-pick, revert and pop stashes, and GitOdile must not be blind
to the states those leave, even though it will not continue them.

GitOdile's own integration (ADR 0030) builds merge versions with
`merge-tree` and `commit-tree` and refuses real overlaps. Task 065-4 will
integrate local branches and diverged upstreams, so an overlap GitOdile itself
finds must become a session the resolver can work on.

Git's conflict truth is the index: up to three stages per path (1 base,
2 current, 3 incoming), any of which may be absent. Conflict markers in the
working tree are only a rendering, may be edited away, and also appear in files
that are not conflicted.

## Decision

### 1. The index and Git's operation markers are the only truth

- A session is read with `git ls-files -u -z` (mode, object ID, stage and raw
  path per entry) and the operation markers in the worktree's own Git
  directory: `MERGE_HEAD`, `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD`, `REVERT_HEAD`, `rebase-merge/`,
  `rebase-apply/` (with `applying` inside it for `git am`). Working-tree
  markers never decide anything. The rebase directories are checked first: a
  rebase that replays a merge (`--rebase-merges`) also writes `MERGE_HEAD`,
  and finishing that pause as a merge would leave the rebase half done.
- Operations: `merge`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `am`, and `unmerged`
  (unmerged entries with no marker, as `git stash pop` or `git checkout -m`
  leave). The domain also names `stash-apply` and `apply-patch` for later; Git
  exposes no marker that tells them apart from `unmerged` today.
- Only a merge with exactly one merge head is **supported**. Every other
  operation, and a merge with several heads (octopus), is read and explained
  with its files, its step where Git records one (`msgnum`/`end`,
  `next`/`last`), and the exact commands to continue or abort with the tool
  that started it. It has no allowed action.
- Reading a session is read-only: no `git status` refresh that rewrites the
  index, no lock files, no marker or ref writes. Opening, refreshing and
  revisiting the resolver therefore cannot change the project.

### 2. Roles come from the operation and real names, not `ours`/`theirs`

| Operation | Stage 2 (current) | Stage 3 (incoming) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| merge | the checked-out branch | the merge head |
| rebase | the branch being rebased onto | the version being replayed (the user's own work) |
| cherry-pick | the checked-out branch | the picked version |
| revert | the checked-out branch | the reverted version's parent side |

The current label is the checked-out branch, or the short commit when
detached. The incoming label of a merge is the branch, remote branch or tag
pointing at `MERGE_HEAD`, found with one `for-each-ref --points-at`; the name in
`MERGE_MSG` is only a hint that must match one of them, because that file is
editable. With no such name the label is the short commit. A rebase reads
`head-name` and `onto` from its own directory.

### 3. File shapes and the classes of epic 037

Each path is classified from which stages exist and their modes: both
changed, both added, deleted by current or by incoming, deleted by both, added
by one side only (the residue of a rename or a file/directory conflict), and
the facets mode change, symbolic link, submodule (gitlink), type change, and
file/directory (the path is a directory on disk). Binary content, encoding and
line endings are facts of a stage's content and are reported when that stage
is read.

Git records a rename conflict under each path separately, with no link
between them in the index. GitOdile shows such paths as their per-path
shapes and does not infer renames; every whole-file choice stays correct per
path. A path that is not valid UTF-8 is listed with a lossy display name and is
`unsupported`: GitOdile will not write to a path it cannot name exactly.

Per-file states are `unresolved` (still unmerged), `editedOutside` (working
content differs from the snapshot), `markedResolved` (in the snapshot, no longer
unmerged), `stale` (unmerged, but its stages differ from the snapshot), and
`unsupported`. Without a snapshot only `unresolved` and `unsupported` can be
told apart.

### 4. Bounds and lazy content

- The unmerged listing is read with a 16 MiB output cap and at most 5,000
  paths; a session past either bound says the list is partial and how many
  paths it read. The file list is virtualized in the frontend.
- Stage content is never part of the session. It is read per file and stage
  with one `cat-file --batch`, capped at 2 MiB (the diff cap), after the
  requested object ID is checked against that path's current stage, so the IPC
  boundary can never read an arbitrary object. Content is returned as text when
  it has no NUL byte in its first 8,000 bytes and is valid UTF-8, otherwise as
  binary with its size.
- Diagnostics carry object IDs, counts and phases, never content or paths.

### 5. Session identity, state token and invalidation

- **Session ID**: a hash of the worktree's Git directory, the operation, the
  `HEAD` commit at the pause, and the operation's head commit(s). It is stable
  across restarts and differs for every new pause.
- **State token**: SHA-256 over the repository identity, the operation markers'
  contents, `HEAD`, the raw unmerged listing, and the working type, size and
  modification time of each unmerged path and of each snapshot path resolved
  since (what a reset of that file would replace). Every later mutation (037-6, 037-5) takes
  the token, revalidates it under the repository write lock and re-reads the
  bytes of the paths it touches; a mismatch is `stale_conflict_session`.
- The IPC layer validates the project session epoch as for every command.
- Invalidation: the watcher already reports `index`, `HEAD`, refs and the
  merge/cherry-pick/revert heads; it now also reports `rebase-merge/` and
  `rebase-apply/`. GitOdile's own `gitodile/` directory never invalidates.
  Overview and the Changes tab read the same cached session summary, refreshed
  on activation and on those invalidations, never on visibility.

### 6. A durable snapshot precedes the first change

Before the first mutation of a session, GitOdile writes a snapshot. A
discard record (ADR 0007) cannot serve: it copies the index file, which may be
a split index, and restores whole working trees rather than one file's stages.

```text
<git-dir>/gitodile/conflicts/v1/<session-id>/
  manifest.json
  files/<sequence>
<git-dir>/gitodile/conflicts/v1/.pending-<unique>/   (never trusted)
refs/gitodile/recovery/v1/conflict/<owner>/<session-id>  -> tree
```

- The manifest (schema version 1) records the session, its origin, the
  operation's heads, every unmerged entry (path, stage, mode, object ID), and
  per path the working state: absent, regular file (bytes in `files/`, with the
  executable bit), symbolic link (target), directory (no contents), or
  `unreadable`/`omitted` when it could not be captured. Missing evidence is
  recorded, never papered over, and makes the manifest `complete: false`.
- Stage objects stay in the object database. A tree built with `mktree`, whose
  entries are the stage blobs, is pinned by a hidden ref in the common
  repository, so `gc` cannot prune an original side after it is resolved. The
  ref points at a tree, not a commit, so it needs no identity. Gitlinks are
  recorded but not pinned; their commits live in another repository.
- Creation runs under the repository write lock, revalidates the state token,
  writes into `.pending-<unique>`, flushes every file and the manifest, and
  publishes with a rename. If a snapshot for the session already exists, it is
  kept: the first snapshot is the original. A crash leaves only a pending
  folder, which is ignored and removed once it is an hour old.
- Total captured bytes are capped at 512 MiB per snapshot; a path past the cap
  is `omitted`, so its unmerged stages can still be reset but not its working
  edits.
- The snapshot is per worktree (its Git directory), and the ref carries the
  worktree's owner ID, as history recovery does. Linked worktrees never share
  sessions or snapshots; they do share the common-directory write lock.
- Retention: the snapshot of a live session is never removed. Snapshots of
  ended sessions are kept for 30 days and at most ten per worktree, and are
  trimmed only when a new snapshot is created, with their refs.
- Privacy: snapshots stay inside the repository's Git directory, are never
  transmitted, and nothing reads them except reset and the recovery center.

The record carries `origin: gitodile | external`. An external origin means
the pre-operation working state is unknown; abort (037-5) must never promise
exact restoration then. This makes the snapshot the first recovery record whose
origin may be outside GitOdile, as the recovery-center seed in `ROADMAP.md`
requires.

### 7. An overlap GitOdile finds becomes a real, paused `git merge`

When task 065-4 integrates a branch or a diverged upstream and `merge-tree`
predicts overlaps, and the user chooses to resolve them, GitOdile starts a real
`git merge` that stops on them, instead of writing stages and `MERGE_HEAD`
itself:

- It refuses first, by name, when there are prepared (staged) changes or an
  unsaved change to a path the merge touches, exactly as `git merge` would
  refuse to protect them, and when another operation is paused.
- It runs `git merge --no-ff --no-commit --no-autostash <commit>` with the
  reviewed commit, so `merge.ff`, `merge.autoStash` and
  `branch.<name>.mergeOptions` cannot change what was previewed. Nothing is
  written to the user's Git configuration.
- It writes a start record, then the history recovery point (ADR 0008),
  immediately before the merge, so the session's origin is `gitodile` and the
  pre-merge state is known.
- Once the merge has paused, the session is the same as one started elsewhere:
  the user's editor and other tools see an ordinary merge, `git merge --abort`
  means what it always means, and finishing runs the merge's own commit hooks
  (`pre-merge-commit`, `prepare-commit-msg`, `commit-msg`) through Git, honours
  signing, and is never bypassed unless hooks are off in Settings.

This amends ADR 0030's point 7 only for an explicit choice to resolve
overlaps. A clean combine still uses `merge-tree` and `commit-tree`, with every
failure before any change.

## Consequences

- One read path serves merges from GitOdile, a terminal, an editor or an agent,
  and the explanation of the operations GitOdile cannot continue.
- Every mutation in 037-6 and 037-5 has a token to revalidate and an original
  to return to, including when the merge was started elsewhere.
- Rename conflicts are shown per path. That is honest and safe, but less
  helpful than a linked rename view; a later task can add one without changing
  the snapshot.
- Snapshots of large conflicted files cost disk inside `.git` until they
  expire, bounded per snapshot and per worktree.
- A GitOdile-started merge can leave `MERGE_HEAD` behind if the app stops
  mid-merge. That is an ordinary paused merge, which the resolver reads like
  any other.

## Alternatives considered

- **Build the session from `merge-tree` output** by writing stages into the
  index and creating `MERGE_HEAD` ourselves. This avoids `git merge`'s refusals
  and configuration, but reimplements what `git merge` writes (`MERGE_MSG`,
  `MERGE_MODE`, `AUTO_MERGE`, conflict-marker content, rename residue) and
  leaves a state that other tools could read differently from Git's own.
- **Trust conflict markers in the working tree.** They can be edited, appear in
  files that are not conflicted, and cannot describe a deletion, a mode change,
  a symbolic link or a submodule.
- **Copy the index file into the snapshot**, as discard recovery does. A split
  index keeps entries in a shared file, and the copy would restore every path
  instead of one file's stages.
- **Pin stage objects with a commit.** A commit needs an identity and a message
  and would appear in history tools; a tree ref needs neither.
