# Architecture

This document describes the architecture that new code must follow. Decision
rationale lives in [`docs/adr/`](adr/); task files and numbered architecture
records are historical evidence, not the current specification.

## System shape

GitOdile is a modular desktop application with a React/TypeScript frontend in
a Tauri shell and Rust services for Git, filesystem, process, session, and
platform-sensitive behavior.

```text
React feature UI
  -> controller + typed port
    -> feature-owned Tauri adapter
      -> ipc.rs transport adapter
        -> application.rs policy/authorization
          -> product domain
            -> git_command.rs / git.rs / filesystem / watcher
```

The important property is dependency direction: presentation depends inward
on feature contracts; domain behavior does not depend outward on React, Tauri,
or transport types.

## Frontend ownership

The frontend is a modular monolith:

```text
src/
  bootstrap.tsx             # renderer entrypoint: mounts React, reveals the window
  styles.css                # eager cascade manifest (tokens -> base -> shell -> features)
  vite-env.d.ts             # build-tool ambient declarations
  raw-icons.d.ts            # `~icons/*` ambient declarations

  app/                      # application shell and composition
    App.tsx                 # composition root and cross-feature orchestration
    screens.tsx             # single screen registry, keep-alive host, prefetch
    project-switcher/       # open-project switcher UI and avatar derivation
    ...                     # overlays, rail nav, titlebar, preferences, branding

  runtime/                  # neutral, product-free runtime contracts
    project/                # runtime store, session state, invalidation acceptance
    screen/                 # screen module and lifecycle contracts

  i18n/                     # translation composition and language runtime
  features/<feature>/       # product owner
  shared/ui/                # proven multi-consumer primitives
  shared/i18n/              # shared copy/error localization
  shared/file-icons/        # deferred file-type icon set
  architecture/             # cross-cutting guard and IPC contract tests
  assets/                   # static artwork
  styles/                   # tokens and base rules
```

The root holds only real entrypoints and ambient declarations. Everything else
has a named owner, and the three neutral owners are deliberately distinct:

- `app/` composes the product. It may import anything; nothing outside it may
  import it.
- `runtime/` holds contracts that are neutral about both product and shell —
  the project store, session reducer, repository-invalidation acceptance and the
  screen lifecycle. Features depend on these; they carry no feature knowledge of
  their own and never hold an ambient current-project singleton.
- `shared/` holds proven multi-consumer primitives behind a public `index.ts`.

There is deliberately no `common/`, `utils/` or shared-types bucket: a module
with no owner is a design question, not a folder.

A feature owns, as applicable:

- domain types and equality rules;
- controller, request generations, caching, and eviction policy;
- typed port and `tauriAdapter.ts`;
- screen descriptor, UI, translations, styles, and tests;
- an explicit `index.ts` public API.

Features may import neutral runtime contracts and another feature's public
`index.ts`; they may not import another feature's internals or app composition.
Only a feature's `tauriAdapter.ts` may import `@tauri-apps/api`. Visual
components receive data and callbacks and never name IPC commands.

Cross-feature orchestration belongs at the composition root. A reusable
primitive moves into `shared/` only after it has multiple real consumers and a
stable, domain-neutral contract.

"As applicable" is load-bearing: a feature that has no transport owns no port
and no `tauriAdapter.ts`. `features/notifications` is the first of those. It is
a domain, a store and a panel; the composition root records into it from the
outcomes it already sees, so there is nothing for it to fetch and no command for
it to name. A feature like that must not grow a read of its own to fill the
gap — the moment a surface fetches to populate itself, it has become one more
thing that runs when the user was doing something else.

### Screens and lifecycle

Every screen is registered once in `src/app/screens.tsx`. The descriptor drives
navigation, command-palette entries, project guards, chunk prefetching,
keep-alive mounting, accessibility behavior, and optional performance budgets.
Do not wire any of those separately in `src/app/App.tsx`.

Overview is eager because it owns first paint. Other functional screens use
`createLazyScreenContainer`; the same loader promise serves lazy mounting and
primary preloading. Overlay panels stay eager: an overlay opens from a click
with no navigation in front of it, and `React.lazy` suspends on first render
even when its module is already warmed, so code-splitting one buys a fallback
frame no prefetch can remove.

Visited project screens remain mounted for the active project epoch:

- `active`: subscriptions and active-only effects may run;
- `hidden`: DOM/local UI state is retained, but the subtree is `hidden`,
  `inert`, unsubscribed from project selectors, and silent;
- `evicted`: the screen unmounts when its project epoch closes or changes.

Use `useActiveProjectSelector` and `useActiveScreenEffect` inside screens.
Visibility is not freshness: never fetch, poll, or warm a cache merely because
a screen became visible.

The complete implementation recipe is in the
[`frontend feature guide`](architecture/frontend-feature-guide.md). Version
lines remains a concrete
[`reference slice`](architecture/version-lines-reference-slice.md).

### Project state and freshness

Each open project owns a `ProjectRuntime` with an immutable reducer snapshot
and a distinct session epoch. The canonical worktree path identifies a
project; the epoch identifies one open incarnation. Responses and watcher
events must match both so work started before close cannot populate a reopened
project.

Runtime instances are passed explicitly. There is no ambient current-project
store. Selectors are narrow and preserve identity when their selected value is
unchanged.

Repository data refreshes only from these owners:

- project activation;
- explicit refresh;
- successful mutation;
- typed repository invalidation.

`RepositoryReadSubscriber` registrations let features join invalidation
fan-out without Repository importing them. Cache warming is separate,
idle-deferred, cancellable, and limited to `project-activation` or
`repository-invalidation` reasons. Background work never precedes first paint.

Status owns working-tree and unpublished-version snapshots. Changes owns
epoch-scoped diff caches, capped at four epochs and 256 diffs / approximately
40 MiB per epoch. Lists that grow with repository size stay virtualized; the
native 1,000-entry payload cap is not a DOM strategy.

Speculative aggregate diff warming is budgeted in Rust, separately from the
16 MiB emergency ceiling on one combined `git diff`. A changeset over 250
entries is deferred before any diff process runs, and the batch stops at 2 MiB
of Git output plus untracked file bytes. `read_working_tree_diffs` answers with
a typed `completed` / `truncated` / `deferred` outcome so a bounded partial warm
is never mistaken for a full preload — and never triggers a request per changed
file either. Whatever the warm skipped loads on demand through `read_file_diff`
when the user opens it.

### Issue reporting

Issue reporting is an app-shell service. Rust's `diagnostics.rs` owns a bounded,
session-only ring buffer of typed Git-invocation and IPC-command events. Command
events retain the checked operation and success or stable error code; Git events
add only an allowlisted subcommand, exit status and duration. Event construction
accepts no repository path, ref, file content, command result or raw Git
argument, and failure excerpts reuse the product's bounded redaction path. The
report states its UTC start, a readable session duration, the retained event
count and whether older events were omitted; timings read as offsets from that
start rather than raw milliseconds. The buffer is managed as Tauri state and is
never persisted unless the user explicitly saves the reviewed report.

`issueReport.ts` builds a URL from the environment block of that reviewed
snapshot and `issueReportContract.json`. Only the versions travel in the
address: a full session encodes to some twelve thousand characters, which GitHub
answers with 414 rather than a form, so the activity reaches the issue through
the clipboard or the attached file instead. `useIssueReport.ts` owns the
review/copy/save/launch flow through `issueReportAdapter.ts`. The titlebar
receives an action, and one eager dialog moves through preparing, review,
opening and browser-failure states. Dismissed attempts cannot restore stale
errors or clipboard state. Opening the form is an explicit external action;
the saved text file must be attached manually. The live tracker/form contract
is checked separately from the offline gate by `pnpm run check:feedback`,
including private vulnerability reporting enablement.

### Styles and translations

`src/styles.css` is the eager cascade manifest: tokens, base, theme transition,
shell, shared primitives, then feature styles. Feature CSS stays beside its
owner but is not lazy-imported, preventing an unstyled first feature frame.
Document-root choreography that no single component owns — the view-transition
pseudo-elements behind a theme change — sits in `styles/`, not in the sheet of
whichever control happens to trigger it.

English and Spanish dictionaries stay beside their owner and are composed in
`src/i18n/index.tsx`. Exact typed locale objects make missing, extra, or incompatible
keys a compile-time error. Shared errors/actions belong in `shared/i18n`; shell
copy belongs in `app/translations.ts`.

## Rust ownership

The Rust side uses flat modules until a module genuinely needs internal
submodules. Two do; the rest are one file each, and file size alone is not a
reason to change that:

```text
src-tauri/src/
  lib.rs                  # Tauri builder, plugins, state, handler registration
  ipc.rs                  # argument extraction, session checks, serialization
  application.rs          # execution-policy inventory and authorization entry
  repository_access.rs    # RepositoryContext + fair commonGitDir coordinator
  git_command.rs          # policy-aware domain-facing Git facade
  git.rs                  # bounded process execution and cancellation
  error.rs                # stable structured application errors
  operation.rs            # shared operation kind and safe diagnostic details
  index.rs                # collision-safe temporary-index preparation
  session.rs              # opaque project epochs
  watch.rs                # filtered/debounced typed invalidation
  app_updates.rs          # bounded signed-update lifecycle and install handoff
  desktop.rs              # desktop-shell services
  tooling.rs              # Git diagnostics, install/update, identity, line endings
  project_settings.rs     # one project's own identity and ignore files
  repository.rs
  clone.rs                # staged provider-neutral acquisition and verification
  initialize.rs           # local-project planning, ownership, and initialization
  platform.rs             # exclusive no-replace directory publication
  status.rs
  changes.rs
  history.rs              # bounded read-only saved-version timeline/details
  recovery/               # two recovery owners that share only a clock
    mod.rs
    discard.rs            # working-tree discard snapshots and safe restore
    history.rs            # pre-rewrite version-line tips as hidden refs
  save_version.rs
  publish.rs
  sync/                   # remotes, upstreams, fetch and relation knowledge
    mod.rs                # remote config and the team-sync read model
    get_team_changes.rs   # the one destructive workflow, with its safety checks
  version_lines.rs        # product domains
  test_support.rs         # shared hermetic Git-repository test fixtures
  tests/<domain>_tests.rs # cross-module integration tests grouped by owner
```

The production body of `lib.rs` contains registration only. `ipc.rs` names the
modules it adapts and delegates immediately. Product domains may depend inward on application,
repository access, Git-command, and shared error contracts; they may not depend
on `ipc`, `watch`, or Tauri. Integration tests live under `src/tests/`, grouped
by the product domain whose behavior they verify; reusable repository fixtures
live in `test_support.rs`, never in the crate composition root.

A module becomes a directory only when it holds responsibilities that are
separate owners, not when it grows long. The bar is a cohesive unit whose
helpers stop being visible to its neighbours: `recovery` split because working-
tree discard and history recovery shared nothing but a clock (and had begun
prefixing helpers `history_*` to avoid colliding in one namespace); `sync` split
because the `get team changes` workflow's eighteen safety helpers were reachable
from the read model that has no business calling them. `architecture.rs` fails
the build if one submodule imports a sibling — whatever they share belongs in
`mod.rs`.

### Repository identity and access

Never assume the selected folder is the repository root. `RepositoryContext`
retains separate identities for:

- worktree root;
- Git directory;
- common Git directory;
- bare/non-bare state;
- backend path and normalized comparison key.

Windows verbatim and ordinary paths compare together while Git receives a
normal path. macOS selected aliases such as `/var` are retained beside their
canonical spelling so watcher events match either form.

The access coordinator is keyed by canonical common Git directory. Reads may
overlap; mutations are exclusive; a queued writer blocks later readers. Linked
worktrees therefore share mutation exclusion while unrelated projects remain
independent. Lock re-entry is rejected; an authorized nested read inherits its
existing permit.

### Repository acquisition

Cloning is an acquisition workflow owned by `clone.rs`, separate from opening
an existing project and from provider-specific integrations. The frontend
`features/clone` owner supplies an eager dialog, attempt-generation controller,
typed port, and Tauri adapter; only `src/app/App.tsx` hands a verified destination to
the existing repository/session lifecycle.

Rust accepts HTTPS, SSH (including scp-like syntax), Git, file URLs, and local
paths. It strips URL user-info, queries, and fragments before Git invocation,
remote persistence, diagnostics, or IPC-safe display. A plan binds the
normalized source and exact absent destination with a state token. Execution
creates `.gitodile-clone-<operation-id>` under the selected parent, writes an
exact ownership marker, clones without recursive submodules, sanitizes
`origin`, verifies repository identity and worktree usability, and publishes
the `project` child with an OS-specific exclusive no-replace rename. It then
verifies the final path before the composition root may open it.

Cancellation belongs to the exact clone operation rather than to a project
epoch, because no project session exists yet. Frontend generations make late
results inert; Rust kills the bounded Git process and removes only a staging
directory whose exact path, type, name, and ownership marker all match. An
existing destination is never cleanup-eligible. `platform.rs` provides the
Windows `MoveFileExW`, Linux `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`, and macOS
`renamex_np(RENAME_EXCL)` publication boundary.

Local creation is a separate acquisition workflow owned by `initialize.rs` and
`features/initialize-project`. Its eager dialog has typed ports and an
attempt-generation controller; only the composition root passes a verified
result into the existing open/session lifecycle. A plan canonicalizes the
parent or existing folder, validates the project and initial version-line
names, rejects case/alias collisions, enclosing or descendant repositories,
linked worktrees and existing `.git` metadata, and snapshots the exact path and
README state. Execution repeats that inspection immediately before mutation.

For a new project, execution exclusively creates the requested absent child;
for an existing ordinary folder it creates only an absent `.git` directory.
Both owned paths receive an operation-specific marker before `git init`, and
the result is accepted only after repository-root, initial-branch, and unborn
state verification. Optional README creation uses create-new semantics. Cleanup
may remove only an exact, operation-marked directory that is still empty apart
from its marker; user files, populated Git metadata, and all pre-existing paths
are never cleanup-eligible. Optional first-save work happens after opening and
reuses the normal identity, hook, signing, temporary-index, and stale-session
contracts.

Connecting a remote is a distinct local configuration mutation in `sync.rs`,
with its own preview and state token. It validates the exact remote name and a
provider-neutral HTTPS, SSH, Git, file, or scp-like URL, removes credentials,
queries, and fragments before IPC or persistence, snapshots the current remote
configuration, and revalidates under exclusive repository access. The action
uses `git remote add`, never contacts the network, never replaces existing
configuration, and verifies the stored fetch/push URL before reporting success.
Later checking and publishing continue through the existing sync flows.

### Execution policies and Git processes

Every registered command has exactly one checked `ExecutionPolicy` defining:

- operation class;
- stdout/stderr caps;
- timeout and cancellation behavior;
- prompt behavior;
- concurrency class.

There is no fallback policy. A production Git call without an application
frame returns a structured failure; debug/test builds panic so the programming
error is visible.

All Git launches use argument vectors, an explicit working directory where
applicable, and deterministic locale. User input is never interpolated into a
shell string. Stdout and stderr drain concurrently and retain only their caps.
Diagnostics redact URL credentials, queries, and fragments.

Equivalent reads may cancel an older process token. Mutations never
automatically cancel one another because interruption can leave an uncertain
outcome. Windows requests descendant cleanup before killing/reaping the tracked
child; macOS/Linux currently guarantee only tracked-child cleanup. The release
hardening requirement is recorded in
[`ADR 0006`](adr/0006-defer-macos-and-linux-runtime-validation.md).

### IPC contract and invalidation

The public IPC surface is pinned in
[`025-ipc-contract.json`](architecture/025-ipc-contract.json). Rust and
TypeScript tests verify command names, arguments, responses, error codes, and
representative serialization. Intentional changes update the JSON contract and
both sides in one review.

Every command that acts on an already-open repository requires `sessionEpoch`,
reads and mutations alike, and a missing epoch fails with `stale_session`
exactly like a stale one. Optionality is a semantic property, never a
compatibility allowance: the contract lists each exception with its reason, and
today those are `open_repository` (an initial open has no epoch yet, and a
supplied one must still be current) and `get_line_endings` (global when no
project path is given, epoch-checked when one is). `watch_repository` and
`unwatch_repository` are scoped to the exact epoch, so a late request from a
closed incarnation cannot detach a newer one's watcher.

Repository watchers emit only:

```ts
type RepositoryInvalidation = {
  projectId: string;
  sessionEpoch: string;
  sequence: number;
  kind: "worktree" | "head_or_refs" | "shared_repository";
};
```

Events are trailing-debounced for 300 ms with a two-second starvation ceiling.
Raw changed paths and repository content never cross IPC. Shared ref/config
changes fan out once to every related open worktree; objects, logs, hooks,
modules, and lock-file churn are filtered. Explicit refresh remains available
if an OS watcher cannot be established.

### Read-only saved-version history

`history.rs` owns the current-`HEAD` saved-version timeline. It is a read-only
domain service behind three narrow commands: `read_history_page`,
`read_saved_version_detail`, and `read_saved_version_file_diff`. The first
returns a bounded `HistoryPage`; the detail commands require both its snapshot
token and a still-reachable commit. All commands require the active project
session epoch and run under the repository read coordinator. They never fetch,
write configuration, move a ref, touch the index, or modify working files.

Pages follow `rev-list --topo-order --date-order --parents HEAD` and include
merge rows without pretending to render a complete branch graph. The service
uses bounded stdin-driven `cat-file --batch-check`/`--batch` reads for raw
commit objects and one NUL-framed `for-each-ref` pass for decorations. Object
lengths, not message delimiters, frame untrusted messages. Page size defaults
to 50 and is capped at 100; messages, decoration counts, Git output, changed
files, and detail diffs each have explicit limits and typed truncation states.

An opaque continuation cursor binds the offset and publication-boundary
progress to a token derived from repository identity, branch/HEAD, shallow
state, and the configured local upstream tracking ref/commit. A changed token
returns `stale_history_cursor`; the frontend restarts at the newest page rather
than appending inconsistent data. Publication state is derived only from local
reachability against that configured tracking commit. Without a usable
upstream, it is `unknown`; History never guesses from a hosting provider or
contacts the network.

Root details compare with Git's empty tree. Ordinary and merge details compare
with the first parent, and merge responses retain every parent for technical
inspection. NUL-framed changed paths and the selected comparison base feed the
existing `changes.rs` typed diff pipeline, so text, binary, too-large,
unchanged, conflict, rename, and truncation semantics have one owner.

The desktop process keeps a read-through cache of page-proven commit context.
It is bounded to four snapshots, 1,000 commits and eight sub-512 KiB details
per snapshot. A selected detail still verifies the current `HEAD`, then needs
only the bounded changed-file read; its first file diff reuses that exact list
instead of enumerating every changed path again. Cache misses use the complete
snapshot/reachability validation path, so eviction never weakens correctness.

The frontend `features/history` owner supplies the port/adapter, generation-
aware controller, lazy keep-alive screen, virtualized timeline/files, and
localized UI. It keeps at most four session caches, 5,000 loaded rows, 24
details, 64 diffs, and 20 MiB of estimated detail/diff data. Project activation
warms the first page without making screen visibility a fetch signal. Shared
repository invalidations refresh it after save, publish, get-team-changes,
version-line changes, watcher events, and explicit repository refresh; project
close evicts the epoch so late results cannot cross incarnations.

## Mutation model

User actions that change history or a remote follow plan, confirm, execute,
and verify phases. Rust revalidates repository state immediately before
execution under the repository-access coordinator.

An operation plan classifies work as read-only, local mutation, history
mutation, remote mutation, or destructive, and carries steps, risks,
confirmation requirements, and recovery information. “Destructive” is a risk
classification, never permission to discard data.

Save-version uses a unique temporary index, restores the real index byte for
byte on failure, and preserves hooks and signing. Publish does not claim
failure after an outcome may have reached the remote; it reports
`publish_uncertain`. Frontend mutation phases supersede stale generations,
coalesce watcher work, and perform one shared follow-up refresh.

Team sync separates local knowledge from explicit network freshness.
`read_team_sync_status` reads only existing remote-tracking refs under a shared
repository-read permit. `check_team_changes`, plus Publish planning/execution
preflights, fetch under an exclusive common-Git-directory permit through the
same `sync.rs` remote, redaction, fetch, and ancestry implementation. Project
activation, screen visibility, watchers, and cache warming never call the
network command.

Get-team-changes extends that single sync domain. Planning and execution each
fetch the exact configured upstream under one exclusive `commonGitDir` permit,
then require a named branch that is strictly behind with zero local-ahead
commits. The plan token binds repository identity, session epoch, branch,
local and remote commits, upstream destination/tracking ref, planned recovery
ref, and the complete porcelain-v2 local-safety snapshot. Incoming versions
are capped at 25 and file evidence at 100 while retaining authoritative totals
and truncation flags. Untracked and ignored paths are compared by complete path
components against added, modified, deleted, and renamed paths; when bounded
evidence cannot prove safety, the operation blocks.

Prepared and unsaved tracked changes use the same complete-path comparison,
including both sides of local and incoming renames. Non-overlapping changes may
continue only after a dry-run two-tree update proves Git can carry them. The
state token also fingerprints the bytes of each changed tracked file or link,
so an edit after preview makes the plan stale. The post-update verifier compares
both that fingerprint and the exact porcelain-v2 tracked-change records from
the reviewed snapshot, preserving staged and unstaged state instead of requiring
a clean index. Truncated incoming-file evidence blocks whenever any local
content would make non-overlap impossible to prove.

Execution repeats the fetch and validation, creates and verifies recovery,
then runs the narrow two-tree update `git read-tree -u -m <old> <target>` and
the compare-and-swap branch move
`git update-ref refs/heads/<branch> <target> <old>`. It never calls `pull`,
merge, rebase, reset, checkout, stash, force, or conflict resolution. A failure
after recovery is conservatively returned as an uncertain local result with
the observed `HEAD` and inspection instructions. The authoritative success
snapshot is committed before exactly one coordinated local refresh; coalesced
watcher invalidations never issue a fetch.

History-mutation recovery follows
[ADR 0008](adr/0008-store-history-recovery-as-versioned-hidden-refs.md): the
previous commit is protected by a create-only ref under
`refs/gitodile/recovery/v1/get-team-changes/`, paired with versioned metadata
in the common Git directory. The newest 20 complete records are retained per
common repository across linked worktrees, and incomplete or unsupported
evidence is never guessed at or deleted.

Discard follows the same plan/revalidate/execute/verify boundary and creates a
persistent record under the selected worktree's Git metadata before mutation.
The record preserves exact target bytes and the real index, can be restored
after restart only while its post-discard state token still matches, and is
defined by [ADR 0007](adr/0007-store-discard-recovery-in-worktree-git-metadata.md).
All retained records are readable, not only the newest: `list_discard_recoveries`
reports each one with whether it can be applied right now, which is what lets
the app offer a choice instead of an undo of exactly one step. That question is
answered per path rather than over the whole tree — a record is applicable while
nothing has been written where it would write — so ordinary work elsewhere no
longer retires every stored record, and several discards can be brought back in
any order. Only a record the whole project still matches also restores the
index; the rest bring their files back and leave the prepared state alone. A new
record that would write exactly what an existing one holds replaces it, so
discarding the same work twice leaves one entry rather than two. The 2026-09-06
amendment to ADR 0007 carries the reasoning, the verification that replaces the
whole-tree comparison in that mode, and the retention rule.

Never silently resolve conflicts, discard untracked files, bypass hooks or
signing, force-push, run `reset --hard`, clean files, or delete a branch without
the confirmation and recovery rules in `AGENTS.md`.

## Application update boundary

[ADR 0010](adr/0010-distribute-signed-app-updates-through-public-github-releases.md)
owns the signed public-release design. The version/channel grammar, candidate
targets, installation-mode fallbacks, native states and errors, immutable
candidate identity, payload limits, credential readiness, and A-to-B
qualification pair are fixed in the
[application update contracts](architecture/app-update-contracts.md). No target
is advertised as automatically supported until its real signed A-to-B evidence
exists. The renderer may request native lifecycle actions using opaque IDs; it
never supplies a feed/channel, URL, public key, installer path, target, or
request headers.

The process-wide operation gate, watcher/background suspension, current command
and draft inventories, rollback order, and extension requirements are defined
in the
[install-admission and draft contract](architecture/install-admission-and-drafts.md).
Every later conflict, integration, stash, helper, timer, or editor owner must
join that contract before it can ship.

`app_updates.rs` is the one process-wide native owner. It compiles the build's
channel, fixed feed and updater public-key identity; detects the native target
and installation mode; and retains at most one immutable candidate and one
verified payload. Its bounded preflight distinguishes transport/status/schema
failures before the exact `tauri-plugin-updater = 2.11.0` Rust API performs the
authoritative check, download, signature verification and platform handoff.
The WebView reaches only six GitOdile commands described by the IPC contract;
no updater/process guest permission or JavaScript updater package is exposed.

`features/app-updates` owns the renderer controller and eager update dialog.
The controller reads and mirrors the process-wide native snapshot, coalesces
every shell entry point, and polls only while a native check, download, or
verification is active; it never infers a second lifecycle or retains payload
bytes. Changelog mounting remains local-only. General Settings stores the
off-by-default consent switch, while the controller owns the settled-startup
timer and its fixed once-per-24-hours in-process cadence. That timer is an
install participant, so preparation suspends it with the other background
owners. The renderer supplies no project identity or stable installation ID.

Install preparation is ordered across the renderer and native process:
synchronously protect drafts, suspend renderer participants, acquire/drain the
global admission gate, suspend native watchers, revalidate the exact candidate
and installation path, persist a bounded one-shot handoff record, then invoke
the installer. A failure unwinds those owners in reverse order. Windows exits
inside the accepted updater handoff; macOS/Linux restart after replacement.
The next launch reports success only when its compiled running version equals
the recorded expected version. Qualification remains a compile-time deny-by-
default target allowlist, so mocks or compilation cannot advertise a platform.

Private packaging follows the two-workflow trust split documented in the
[signed-build runbook](release/signed-builds.md). A tag-only, secretless matrix
builds exact-source packages; a `workflow_run` loaded from the protected default
branch revalidates the Git object and complete matrix before protected jobs can
see signing credentials. Those jobs never check out candidate source. Updater,
OS-trust and notarization results remain separate evidence fields, and the final
matrix record is explicitly non-promotable. Public release/feed writes belong
to 065-9-6; installed A-to-B qualification and target enablement belong to
065-9-7.

## Enforced checks

`pnpm run check` is the repository gate:

- `check:docs` validates local Markdown links, work-item state/completion
  metadata, unique task IDs, README package metadata, and application-version
  consistency across npm, Cargo, and Tauri;
- `check:architecture` analyzes production, type-only, dynamic, and test edges,
  rejects forbidden directions/cycles and an eager `shared/file-icons`, and proves its
  rules with seeded violations;
- TypeScript strict checking, Vitest, and the production Vite build;
- `cargo fmt --check`, Clippy with warnings denied, and all Rust tests;
- Rust syntax-based tests pin module ownership, keep `lib.rs` registration-only,
  reject crate-root glob transport imports, keep a split module's submodules from
  reaching sideways into each other, and verify the IPC/policy inventory.

Performance comparison protocol and retained budgets live in the
[`architecture baseline`](architecture/023-performance-baseline.md). Enable
`VITE_PROFILE_SCREEN_SWITCHES=true` only while profiling; instrumentation is
absent from normal development and production builds.

## Platform and security constraints

### Canonical product identity

The shipped product, npm/Cargo packages, Rust crate, executable, frontend
assets, and browser preferences use **GitOdile** / `gitodile`:

- Tauri uses the bundle identifier `app.gitodile.desktop`;
- browser preferences use `gitodile-*`, without a brand-compatibility reader;
- recovery schema v1 uses `refs/gitodile/recovery/...` and
  `<git-dir>/gitodile/...`;
- source links target `https://github.com/martinezelx/project-gitodile`; user
  feedback targets the public `https://github.com/martinezelx/gitodile-feedback`.

The owner explicitly authorized a breaking pre-release identity reset, recorded
in [ADR 0009](adr/0009-use-only-the-canonical-product-identity.md). Previous-brand
preferences and recovery records are no longer read or migrated; no existing
data is deleted. An installation under the new identifier may start with fresh
WebView state and coexist with an earlier installation.

Future changes to state-bearing identifiers require a separately reviewed
migration or explicit reset decision and recovery tests.

- Repository content stays local unless the user explicitly invokes a remote
  feature.
- Tauri capabilities remain minimal; no generic command-execution endpoint is
  permitted.
- Repository content, config, hooks, remote responses, and paths are untrusted.
- Repository content is never rendered as markup. A picture — an SVG
  included — is drawn as an `<img>` with a `data:` URL, a context in which
  the engine runs no script and fetches no external resource. Inlining it
  would hand repository content the application's own document and origin.
- Never log credentials, helper output, private keys, or authenticated remote
  URLs.
- AI features require explicit consent and disclosure of transmitted data.
- Paths, casing, symlinks, line endings, credentials, file locks, prompts, and
  process behavior across Windows/macOS/Linux are correctness concerns.

CI checks Rust on all three platforms and release-compiles macOS/Linux desktop
executables. Actual macOS/Linux WebView behavior, accessibility, memory,
signing, and packaging remain unmeasured release gates, not implied support
claims.

## When an ADR is required

Add an ADR before changing a durable decision such as the Git backend, state
management model, credential storage, updates, telemetry, AI providers, WSL
support, or extension architecture. Small ownership-preserving refactors do
not need an ADR; update this document when the current architecture changes.
