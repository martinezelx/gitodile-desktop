 * - `screens` — the part of `app` spent inside the screen host, so the two
 *   together say whether the cost is the screen or everything around it.
 * - `paint` — from the commit to the browser having painted the next frame:
 *   style, layout, and paint.
 * - `total` — from the click to that painted frame. Anything outside React's
 *   render (event handling, effects, forced reflow, waiting on IPC) shows up
 *   as the gap between `total` and the rest.
 *
 * Wrap the whole app in this, not just the screens — measuring only the screen
 * subtree is what hid the constant per-switch cost in the first place.

 *
 * Why: the caches from task 019 made screen data instant, but each switch
 * still rebuilt the screen's DOM from scratch — for Changes that means the
 * whole file list plus a virtualizer remount whose rows measure themselves on
 * first render. Not unmounting is a property this host provides once, rather
 * than an optimisation every future screen has to repeat.
 *
 * Three details carry the behaviour:
 *
 * - **Mount on first visit, not eagerly.** A screen the user never opens costs
 *   nothing, so the first-paint work task 018 protected is untouched.
 * - **Inactive screens are frozen.** Their element from the last time they were
 *   active is re-rendered by identity, so React bails out of that subtree and
 *   an unrelated `App` state change cannot re-render a screen nobody is
 *   looking at. They pick up current props on the frame they become active
 *   again.
 * - **Hidden means gone.** `hidden` plus `inert` keeps an inactive screen out
 *   of the tab order, out of the accessibility tree, and unable to announce
 *   status updates from behind the visible one.
 *
 * Eviction is the caller's job and is done with `key`: keying this host by the
 * active project session drops that session's screens when the project
 * changes or closes, so nothing stale survives and memory does not grow with
 * the number of projects visited. */
