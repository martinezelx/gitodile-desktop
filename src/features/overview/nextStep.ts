 * - `ready` — the theme's accent: saved work waiting to be published, the step
 *   that closes the loop.
 * - `incoming` — `--status-renamed`, the theme's blue: something new is on the
 *   remote.
 * - `blocked` — `--status-danger`: overlapping changes, or files that could
 *   not be read.
 * - `calm` — no tint: nothing is waiting, or the card only reports.
